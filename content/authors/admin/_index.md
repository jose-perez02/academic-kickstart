Hi, welcome to my website.

I'm a fourth-year undergraduate in astronomy and physics at the University of Arizona.
Some of the areas that I've explored include Python development for calibration, processing, and analysis of astronomical images for the exoplanet survey [EDEN Project](http://project-eden.space/), and interfacing with measurement devices at the [Imaging Technology Lab](http://www.itl.arizona.edu/doku.php).

I've also had the chance to work with a small team on developing an augmented reality mobile application, [EHTGo](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.astroxr.ehtgo), using video game development tools, with the purpose of showcasing the [EHT](https://eventhorizontelescope.org/) locations on a globe.

In the summer 2019 I will be participating in the [Banneker Institute](https://bannekerinstitute.fas.harvard.edu) Summer Program at Harvard University, where I'll be working closely with a faculty member on an intense project, while attending weekly discussions on social justice issues.
